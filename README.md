Here I will be uploading source code of SMGEngine. This is part of my school project to teach a few students how to develop 3D Game Engine with OpenGL and use it to create 3D first-person shooter game. The engine is inspired and uses the structure of the ZFXEngine from the book "3D Game Engine Programming" written by Stefan Zerbst and Oliver DÃ¼vel.
